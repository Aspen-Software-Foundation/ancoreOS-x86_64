1 - Introduction

    The VNiX Operating System is a Unix-Like OS that is being developed by the Aspen Software Foundation for a specific purpose
    This purpose is to run multiple executable files in the same operating system without having to dual boot. The main executable
    types that this OS plans to run are the Microsoft Windows' EXE type, and Linux's ELF type.

    Most of the components inside this operating system are licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2 or later unless specified

    or see to the LICENSE file in the project's root directory.


3 - Core features

    Currently, the VNiX Operating System uses Cuoreterm for the framebuffer. Cuoreterm is a super lightweight and freestanding framebuffer made by JerryJhird
    for CuoreOS. VNiX also features RISCV32 program support, made by Dcraftbg. For more information about either one of these project, visit the links below:
    This OS also features the Limine Bootloader, because of its extensive features and ease of use. I personally support its goals and achievements, which is why
    I've included it in this project.
